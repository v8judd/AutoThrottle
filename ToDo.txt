- test controller with 10 and 50 ms intervals in the flight loop (all other settings as of now)
- add simple widget to set the desired speed to hold
- if AP is active, get set speed from AP either IAS or Mach
- further tune PID components of the controller to reach decent stabillity especially with winds
